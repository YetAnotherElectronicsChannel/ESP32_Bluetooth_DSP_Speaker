# ESP32 Bluetooth DSP Speaker

I tried to build up a Bluetooth-Speaker based on the A2DP_Sink_Example from Espressif.
I connected a PCM5102 DAc and a TPA3116 amplifier and integrated everything into a cheap bookshelf-speaker.
I did the frequency X-Over for the woofer and the tweeter digitally inside the ESP32 with the help of IIR filters.
